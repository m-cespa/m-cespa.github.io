      <p>
        This "blog" was largely motivated by friends who recommended I add this
        as a section to my website - not that I will be sharing anything
        particularly groundbreaking (for that see
        <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham's website</a>). 
        I recently got a whiteboard and find myself working on random problems, 
        often over breakfast. I find it useful to write down what I work on - 
        explaining stuff tends to help the explain-er just as much as the explain-ee. 
        Some posts might be longer discussions on bits of maths/CS/physics I stumble across, 
        others might be a one-off interesting problem.
